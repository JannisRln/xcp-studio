## Context / desired behavior

Initial live panel and proposed PR #18 chart buffer exist but do not meet backend-owned acquisition, gap and recording requirements.

**Desired outcome:** Real measurement workspace, charts and CSV accuracy. Implement according to [product specification](../product-specification.md), [architecture](../architecture.md) and [API contract](../api-contract.md), where applicable.

## Scope

- [ ] Build reusable time-series chart with correct time axis, legend, zoom/pan, cursor and per-unit scale policy.
- [ ] Provide a signal table with raw/physical values, quality, type, unit and timestamp.
- [ ] Implement separate view pause vs acquisition stop, reconnect/error handling and sample-gap rendering.
- [ ] Export only actual backend-captured samples with timestamp/unit/quality semantics.
- [ ] Keep rendering bounded/decimated while backend capture remains complete.

## Non-goals

- No fake charts presented as ECU output.
- Backend recorder is T-0015; do not rely on browser buffer for long recordings.

## Owned paths and interface boundaries

- frontend/src/features/measurements/, frontend/src/components/chart* and measurement-specific CSS/tests.
- Consume DTOs from T-0012; do not redefine WS schema or session lifecycle.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Simulator values flow from one backend acquisition into chart/table and CSV with matching timestamps.
- [ ] Gaps, invalid samples and disconnected states are visible; no synthetic values leak into real view.
- [ ] View pause does not stop backend capture; explicit stop does.
- [ ] Keyboard interactions, unit labels and 10k+ sample render performance pass tests.

## Verification plan

- [ ] Component tests, CSV golden fixture and browser E2E connect→plot→export.
- [ ] Document chart sampling/decimation and any unsupported interactions.
- [ ] Current PR head passes required CI and negative-path tests; distinguish simulator from HIL evidence.
